Iâ€™m Luca Cossu, Post doc researcher in Bioengineering at the University of Padova.

I received the MSc degree in Bioengineering in 2019 and the Ph.D. degree in Information Engineering (Bioengineering curriculum) in 2025 at the Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.

My research interests mainly focus on wearable devices and the collection, processing and exploitation in the clinical setting, particularly focusing on usability and accessible data analysis pipelines. I'm also working on the development of new decision support algorithms based on artificial intelligence for improving treatment effectiveness in chronic metabolic diseases.

I am currently working in the following research projects: DARE (funded by the Italian Minister of Research under the PNRR initiative), BRAINTEASER (funded under the EU-H2020 initiative), GLUCOMFORT (funded by the Italian Minister of Research under the PRIN 2021 initiative), and BREATHE (funded by the Italian Minister of Research under the PRIN 2022 initiative).
